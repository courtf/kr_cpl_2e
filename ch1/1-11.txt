How would you test the word count program?

1) Use very large input.
2) Use very large input with a very large number of whitespace characters.
3) Use very large input with zero whitespace characters.
4) Use empty input.

What kinds of input are most liekly to uncover bugs if there are any?

A) Typically tests that encounter edge cases and boundaries of the program. Things like
empty input, gigantic input (that might overflow the counter variables) and input
that has no whitespace at all.
